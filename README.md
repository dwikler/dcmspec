# Documentation generated by MkDocs

This `README.md` is for informational purposes only.  
It is included in the deployed documentation files but is **not linked or rendered** as part of the documentation site.

The `gh_pages` branch contains the static files for the `dcmspec` documentation, generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Documentation is automatically built into the `./site` folder and deployed here by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/doc.yml` on the `main` branch.  
A bot Action then deploys the site to GitHub Pages at [https://dwikler.github.io/dcmspec](https://dwikler.github.io/dcmspec).
