# Documentation generated by MkDocs

This branch contains the static documentation site generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).  
The site files are deployed in the `docs` folder of this branch, as GitHub Pages is configured to serve content from the `docs` directory.  
The site is automatically built and deployed by the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/doc.yml` in the main project repository.
